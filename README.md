# First-Creative
Scripts that I wrote for a hospital video library with the old YouTube API. The scripts pulled all the videos from the hospital's
Youtube channel and created the HTML for each video, and added classes based on the video content using the title and description.

###hosh.videolibrary-v2.js
Created a video library only for all the doctors in HOSH. 


###hosp.videolibrary.js
Created a video library only for the HOSH doctors that were part of the HOSP group. 

##Plugins
I used [Colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) as a lightbox. I also used [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) for the 
video masonry and filtering animations.
